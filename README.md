Recursive methods
=================

### Makers Academy Week 4 task

This task was set whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to practice writing
recursive methods in Ruby using RSpec for TDD.

I wrote three recursive methods:

  - `sum(array)` - to sum all the elements of an array
  - `palindrome?(array)` - returns true if the array is a palindrome
  - `Array#injecty` - an implemention of some of the functions of the standard Array#inject method
